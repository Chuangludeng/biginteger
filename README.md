# biginteger
A C# BigInteger implementation based on the BigInteger class by ScottGarland (http://biginteger.codeplex.com).

This class can be used in Unity, since the System.Numerics is not available there.

This version introduces some fixes and additions to the original file. (WIP)
### Current fixes:

BigInteger.Add(..) was originally subtracting the numbers

### Current additions:
